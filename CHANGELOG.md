All notable changes to this project are documented here. Format loosely
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); milestones map to
`PLAN.md`.

## [Unreleased]

### M3 — requests & approvals (self-service)

- Six tools: `request_role`, `list_my_requests`, `list_work_items`, `get_case`,
  `approve_work_item`, `reject_work_item`.
- `request_role` submits an assignment-add delta on the target user (defaults to
  the authenticated user); midPoint policy decides whether it executes directly
  or opens an approval **case**. The requester identity is always the
  authenticated principal — midPoint sets `requestorRef`; the tool never accepts
  an on-behalf-of requester. After applying, it best-effort surfaces the created
  case oid.
- `list_my_requests` scopes cases to `requestorRef` = self; `list_work_items` is
  the caller's inbox — open cases where `workItem/assigneeRef` = self, returning
  only the caller's still-open work items. Both resolve the caller via
  `/ws/rest/self`, so identity comes from the credentials, not from arguments.
- `approve_work_item` / `reject_work_item` complete a work item via
  `POST /ws/rest/cases/{oid}/workItems/{id}/complete` with the approval-outcome
  URI; both respect the write gate (dry-run preview when off), as does
  `request_role`.
- REST verified against the 4.10 docs: cases `GET`/`POST …/search`,
  work-item `…/complete` (204). Note: an older support-4.10 example page still
  flags work-item completion as unimplemented (MID-6067), but the current cases
  endpoint reference documents it; the integration test is the live check.
- Tests: fixture-based decoding of cases/work-items (incl. inbox filtering to
  self + open items), request/complete delta correctness, MCP round-trip and
  gate on/off proofs. Integration test extended with the full request → case →
  approve → assignment-appears flow (opt-in via `MIDPOINT_IT_APPROVAL_ROLE_OID`).
  `go test ./...` green.

### M2 — write tools + gate

- Six write tools: `create_user`, `enable_user`, `disable_user`, `assign_role`,
  `unassign_role`, `recompute_user`.
- `MIDPOINT_MCP_ALLOW_WRITES` gate (default off). When off, every write tool
  returns a **dry-run preview** — the exact method, endpoint, and request body it
  *would* send — and makes no mutating call. When on, it applies the change and
  reports the result (e.g. the new oid from the create `Location` header).
- REST mapping verified against the 4.10 docs: create via `POST /ws/rest/users`
  (`{"user":{…}}` → 201 + `Location`); enable/disable/assign/unassign via
  `PATCH /ws/rest/users/{oid}` with an `objectModification`/`itemDelta`
  (`replace activation/administrativeStatus`; `add assignment`; `delete
  assignment[<id>]`); recompute via `PATCH …?options=reconcile` with an empty
  modification. `unassign_role` reads the user first to resolve the exact
  assignment container id(s).
- Write path is structured as build-a-Plan then apply, so the preview and the
  applied request are guaranteed identical.
- Tests: delta-JSON correctness for every plan, `Location`→oid parsing, and MCP
  round-trip tests proving the gate — **gate off makes no write call and returns
  a preview; gate on issues the expected PATCH/POST**. Integration test extended
  with a live disable→enable round-trip (runs only when the gate is on).
  `go test ./...` green.

### M1 — read tools

- Seven read-only MCP tools: `search_users` (free-text over name/full
  name/email, or exact OID), `get_user`, `get_user_assignments` (direct
  assignments plus effective membership, each flagged direct or inherited),
  `list_roles`, `get_role`, `list_resources`, `get_resource` (with connection
  status where midPoint reports it). All return structured output plus a
  human-readable line.
- REST client extended with a generic request core (GET/POST, query options),
  `POST /ws/rest/{type}/search` using midPoint's text query language, and
  `GET /ws/rest/{type}/{oid}?options=resolveNames`. Tolerant decoding handles
  midPoint's JSON quirks: PolyStrings as string or object, and single-element
  collections serialized as a bare object instead of an array.
- Search input is escaped into query-language string literals so a
  caller-supplied value can't inject filter syntax; result sizes are capped
  (default 20, max 100).
- Table-driven tests against recorded REST fixtures (`internal/midpoint/testdata`)
  covering search/get/list, the array/single-object envelope, direct-vs-inherited
  membership, and the injection-escaping guard; plus an in-process MCP
  round-trip test that drives every tool through the SDK (verifying input/output
  schema validation, including empty arrays marshaling as `[]` not `null`).
- Integration test (`-tags=integration`) against a live midPoint 4.10 container;
  skips cleanly when `MIDPOINT_*` is unset, so a missing container is never a
  failure. `go test ./...` green.

### M0 — scaffold

- Go module `github.com/mckay22/midpoint-mcp-server` (Go 1.25; the MCP SDK
  requires >= 1.25).
- stdio MCP server exposing one tool, `ping`, which calls midPoint
  `GET /ws/rest/self` and returns the authenticated identity (oid, name, and
  full name / email when set), as both human-readable text and structured
  output.
- `internal/midpoint`: minimal REST client with HTTP Basic auth. Config comes
  from `MIDPOINT_URL`, `MIDPOINT_USERNAME`, `MIDPOINT_PASSWORD`; optional
  `MIDPOINT_INSECURE_TLS=true` skips certificate verification for self-signed
  dev instances only. Credentials are read from the environment at runtime and
  never appear in code, logs, or errors.
- Table-driven tests for the client (recorded `/ws/rest/self` responses via
  `httptest`, covering PolyString-object and bare-string `name` forms, non-2xx
  handling, and a guard that errors never leak the password) and for
  `ConfigFromEnv`. `go test ./...` green.

### Dependencies

- `github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk` v1.6.1 — the official Model Context
  Protocol SDK for Go; mandated by `PLAN.md` as the server framework. Its
  transitive dependencies (`google/jsonschema-go`, `segmentio/encoding`,
  `segmentio/asm`, `yosida95/uritemplate`, `golang.org/x/oauth2`,
  `golang.org/x/sys`) are pulled in indirectly. No other direct dependencies —
  everything else uses the standard library.
